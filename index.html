      		<p>Work on the project started by defining key personas that defined the user base.  This helped define and focus the work on a few key groups that would be using the application.  Using personas allowed me to get into the head of my users.  As I considered each phase of the design process I would ask myself “What would Steve do?” or 'What would John think?' Keeping my mind and empathy focused on who I was designing for was crucial for ensuring that the design truly met the needs of the people I was designing for.</p>

	      	<h3>How We Did It</h3>

	      		<p>Creating a sitemap helped me track of the different pages that were being re-designed and added to the platform.  As new pages and flows were designed and considered the sitemap served as a living document that tracked the completion and stages of the project.  It also served as an important exercise in thinking through the architecture of pages and how they fit into the scheme of the overall website.</p>

	      	<h3>User Flows</h3>
	      	<img src="assets/profile@3x copy.png" class="hero" />
	      		<p>Part of the challenge for this application was to design new flows that hadn’t yet been a large part of the user's experience.  Quickly thinking through and mocking up some user flows allowed me to test them out with a couple of users to gain some insight on what process and steps might work the best.  Part of the intuitive system required a better way to educate new users on how to use the platform.  Testing confirmed that the onboarding process should be a distinct process from using the platform.  This would allow users to better learn the software and keep them from getting overwhelmed and confused by having too much information presented to them at once.  Other tasks and flows revealed the importance of a comprehensive dashboard in the completion of everyday tasks.  </p>

	      	<h3>Sketching Ideas</h3>
	      	<img src="assets/clubworx_sitemap_combined@3x copy.png" class="hero" />
	      		<p>After gaining a lot of feedback and insight during my sketch iterations I was able to pinpoint exactly which designs and pages I wanted to include in my wireframes and prototypes.  I decided to use Axure to build my prototypes and wireframes due to the powerful options that the it offered for building prototypes.  Most of the important concept testing occurred in the sketching phase but I still performed a couple of guerilla tests with users to make sure the designs addressed their needs properly.</p>
	    
	      	<h3>Rapid Prototyping and Wireframes</h3>
	      	<img src="assets/clubworx_sitemap_combined@3x copy.png" class="hero" />
	      		<p>After building up some of the key flows and processes I decided to jump into quickly sketching up some potential designs for key screens.  Exploring the designs via sketching aided in the brainstorming process rather than focusing on picture perfect quality and computer design.  Using the Microsoft RITE method of prototyping at this phase I was able to get feedback from a user and immediately sketch out a new design or modify the a design immediately then re-test these iterations with a new user</p>
